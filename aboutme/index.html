        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <h2>Balázs Agócs</h2>
        <img alt="Image of me and elder Boxx" src="images/aboutme.jpg" >
        <p>My name is Balázs, and I'm from Hungary. I am living in the capitol, Budapest.</p>
        <p>You say "Balázs", like you say the "a" in "want" and the "ázs" is like the french "age" in for example "frommage". :)<br>UTF-8 is one of the greatest things for Hungarians, because you don't have to use "&#38;aacute" anymore.</p>
        <p>I'm 45 years old, I have made my first webpage in university, when rotating animated skulls and flames were the coolest things.</p>
        <p>I chose Web Programming, because I want to write my own webpages and code. Currenty I can only modify others code and play around with templates built by others. I have been stuck at the same intermediate level with webpage making for years.<br>My current job description is IT Support Helpdesk Agent. But I also never learned IT, I just live by my experiences as a user.<br>I would like to learn both and be better at them, to help others get their own websites and to help them with their IT problems.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are playing Warhammer 40k (tabletop game with miniature plastic models), sightseeing as a tourist and helping the missionaries learn Hungarian.</p>
        <p>I'm a fresh, new and enthusiastic member of the church for 2.5 years now. It has changed my life to the positive, and it keeps changing it, with every visit to the temple, with every institute class I take and with every question answered in prayer or in the general conference.</p>
